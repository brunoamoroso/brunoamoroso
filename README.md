# üëã Hi there
I'm Bruno Amoroso, I consider myself an enthusiast in building products. I started in the tech industries in the end of 2014 as a full stack web developer, then decided to focus on UX Design which got me a Bachelor's Degree. Although recently I felt that I was more inclined to go back to developing things, so I could turn my design in real things.
